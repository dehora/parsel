# Parsel

Parsel is a set of scripts to create an AMI for Cassandra/Kafka and deploy clusters into EC2.

It borrows instance creation techniques from  [ComboAMI](https://github.com/riptano/ComboAMI),
and uses [Priam](https://github.com/netflix/Priam) with auto-scaling groups for instance management.

AMI creation is done with [Packer](https://packer.io/).
